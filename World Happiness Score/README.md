# World Happiness Score

Exploratory analysis of World Happiness Score. Hipothetical scenario where a governator ask us a simulation of which score he will get with different combination of the variables. Main issue, we don't have the real variables just a transformation of them, and we hava a Variable called Dystopia Residual based on the worst score in each variables for that year, that make our prediction harder.
